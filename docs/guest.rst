NREC currently only supports authentication via Feide. UiB and UiO
users can `sign up`_ natively. The same is true for users at a few
other Norwegian universities. Other users will need to get a **guest
account** at UiB or UiO to use NREC.


Who can use NREC natively
-------------------------

Users at the following Norwegian universities can `sign up`_ natively
and have full access to NREC:

* University of Bergen (UiB)
* University of Oslo (UiO)

Users at the following Norwegian universities and institutions can
`sign up`_ natively and be a **member** of a UiB or UiO project:

* Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)
* The Arctic University of Norway (UiT)
* University of Agder (UiA)
* Norwegian Agency for Shared Services in Education and Research (Sikt)


Getting a Guest Account
-----------------------

Users that are not from any of the institutions mentioned above will
need a guest account at either UiB or UiO. See below for how to
proceed:

* **UiB**:

  - `How to register guests for user account`_ | `Norwegian version <https://hjelpekort.app.uib.no/KI-1433.html>`_

* **UiO**:
  
  - `Guest Registration – invite service for UiO's guests`_ | `Norwegian version <https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/brukernavn-passord/gjestetjenesten/>`_
  - `Guest access to UiO's IT systems [For employees]`_ | `Norwegian version <https://www.uio.no/for-ansatte/arbeidsstotte/lonnsadministrasjon/gjest.html>`_

When the guest account has been generated the user may use NREC like
any other UiB or UiO user.
