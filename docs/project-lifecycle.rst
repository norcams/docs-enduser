Project Lifecycle
=================

All NREC projects have a life span determined by the date of the
creation and the expiration date, sometimes referred to as "end
date". This document outlines what happens to a project

* **before** it reaches its expiration date
* **when** it reaches its expiration date
* **after** the expiration date

The figure below is a graphical representation of the life cycle of a
project. The project is created and enters normal operation. At the
end of its lifetime it enters quarantine status for 90 days and is
then deleted.

The main motivation for enforcing a limited life span for projects is
to make sure that projects are deleted when they are no longer in
use. This mitigates security issues that would otherwise arise as the
result of unmaintained instances (servers), and frees up resources for
other users.


Policy
------

A new project is created with a maximum expiration date of 2 years,
except vGPU projects which is 6 months. Before a project reaches its
expiration date, the administrator of the project, as well as the 
contact if it exists, will be notified by email. When a project 
reaches expiration date, it is put into quarantine for 90 days and
then deleted. When a project is deleted, all of its resources
(instances, volumes, snapshots etc.) and all data contained within
those resources are deleted forever. There are no backups.

Detailed description of the policy:

#. **60 days before expiration date**: An email is sent to the project
   admin (and contact, if it exists) warning about pending quarantine

#. **30 days before expiration date**: An email is sent to the project
   admin (and contact, if it exists) warning about pending quarantine

#. **7 days before expiration date**: An email is sent to the project
   admin (and contact, if it exists) warning about pending quarantine

#. **At expiration date**: The project is put into quarantine. The
   following happens to a project that enters quarantine:

   - All instances are shut off
   - The project is disabled. Disabled projects can not be interacted
     with, and they are not visible in the dashboard
   - The project is tagged as being in quarantine
  
#. **30 days after entering quarantine**: An email is sent to the
   project admin (and contact, if it exists) warning about pending
   deletion

#. **60 days after entering quarantine**: An email is sent to the
   project admin (and contact, if it exists) warning about pending
   deletion

#. **90 days after entering quarantine**: The project is deleted

This process may be interrupted at any time. See `Expiration Date
Extension`_ below. If a project is enabled from quarantine, the
project's administrator and members are responsible for activating
instances that were shut off when the project entered quarantine.

Mailing lists
-------------

.. _Create a new mailing list in Sympa: https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/email-calendar/mailinglists/help/administrate/new-list.html

If you share responsibilities in administering a project, we recommend
creating a mailing list and include this list in the 'Optional
contact' field when applying for a project. The list will then be used
for automatic E-mails from support@nrec.no, such as project changes,
maintenance and security issues.

For UiO-users, the instructions for creating a mailing list can be
found here: `Create a new mailing list in Sympa`_. We recommend
choosing the following options when creating a mailing list for use in
the contact field on your UiO NREC project:

* List type: Hotline mailing list

* Audience: Forskningsgrupper

* Purpose: List of employees and external participants, related to
  UiO's purpose, where external can be impersonal addresses. The list
  is owned by one or more employees.
  

Expiration Date Extension
-------------------------

A project's expiration date can be extended at any time. The maximum
allowed lifetime for a project is two years from today. Extending the
lifetime is an administrative task and must be performed by the NREC
team. To change the expiration date for a project, please contact NREC
support by sending an email to

* support@nrec.no

In normal circumstances, expiration date extension is merely a
formality and is granted without question. Do not hesitate to ask for
an extension if needed.
